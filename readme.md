Simple RESTful Todo App 

I built a simple Todo Application by using Laravel, AngularJS, Bootstrap and Satellizer.

I used the resource routing of Laravel 5 to create a REST API for the backend of the application and the power of AngularJS for the frontend.

REQUIREMENTS

•	Laravel or LAMP stack - Laravel is a free, open-source PHP web application framework and intended for the development of web applications following the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern. You can also use WAMP stack.

•	AngularJS - AngularJS is an open-source web application framework maintained by Google and by a community of individual developers and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications.

•	Bootstrap - Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.

•	Satellizer - Satellizer is a simple to use, end-to-end, token-based authentication module for AngularJS.

•	jwt-auth - jwt-auth is a well made Laravel module for AngularJS for implementing the token authorization system.

I recommend that you should install WAMP or LAMP stack. Because it also includes Apache, MySQL and many other frameworks.

I also recommend that you should install Satellizer for token-based authentication and jwt-auth for token authorization.
